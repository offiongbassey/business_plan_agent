# DesignVet Business Plan

## Executive Summary
DesignVet was founded with the mission of becoming the leading platform that connects freelance designers with startup founders for seamless business opportunities.
We are looking for seed funding to fuel our growth over the next 24 months.

## Problem
Start-ups struggle with identifying and employing qualified designers while freelance designers face barriers in finding reliable organizations for employment. 

## Solution
We seek to bridge this gap by providing a platform that benefits both parties - 1. Quality assurance in freelancers for organizations, 2. Secure and reliable employment for freelancers.

## Market Opportunity
- TAM: $24 trillion (Freelancing market by 2032)
- SAM: $885 billion (Skilled freelancing market)
- SOM: Expected to capture 1% of SAM in the first five years
With North America being home to a large number of freelancers, our initial target would be the domestic market, with plans to expand globally in subsequent years.

## Business Model & Pricing
We earn revenue through charging a 5% fee per design work delivered and also through vetting of freelancers.
  
**Tier 1:** High volume, lower price point
**Tier 2:** Premium services, higher price point

## Go-to-Market Strategy
The majority of the sales and marketing budget will be devoted to digital marketing and SEO efforts. We also anticipate strong organic growth through word-of-mouth and referrals.

## Competitive Analysis
Key Competitors: Fiverr, Upwork, 99designs, Toptal, DesignCrowd
USP: Rigorous designer vetting, a platform specialized for design work

## Operations Plan
Key hires in product, marketing, and operations. We estimate the need for around 15 employees by the end of year 1, growing to 60 by year 3.

## Team & Hiring Plan
The founding team boasts of experience in design, startups and technology. We're looking to fill key roles in product management, marketing, operations, and engineering.

## Financial Highlights
Targeting to reach 500 startups annually for break-even. Predicting LTV/CAC ratio of 3:1 and a churn rate of 10% to hit profitability by year 3.

## Risks & Mitigation
Potential Risks: Market competition, pricing challenges, operational scalability
Mitigations: Robust go-to-market strategy, aggressive digital marketing, scalable platform architecture

## Impact & Vision
Promote the skilled freelance market, encourage quality work, and stimulate the gig economy.

## Funding Ask & Use of Funds
We seek seed funding round for $500k split evenly between platform development, marketing & customer acquisition, vetting processes, and to buffer the operational costs.
