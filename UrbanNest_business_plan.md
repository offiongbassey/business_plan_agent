# UrbanNest Business Plan

## Executive Summary
UrbanNest is a digital real estate platform aimed at transforming the way landlords and real-estate agents engage in rental and sale transactions by providing a robust and integrated solution. With the PropTech market expected to reach USD 106.97 billion by 2032, UrbanNest is well-positioned to capitalize on this growing opportunity.

## Problem 
The real estate industry has been relatively slow in adopting digital transformations. This has resulted in a disjointed market with customers often left frustrated with the transaction process.

## Solution

## Market Opportunity 
Based on our research and market trends, we have estimated our TAM to be USD 106.97 billion by 2032. Our initial target market (SAM) is estimated to be around 10% of TAM, while our achievable market (SOM) will be close to 1.5% of TAM during the initial years. 

## Business Model & Pricing
Our revenue streams include:
1. Commissions on rentals/sales.
2. Premium listing fees for landlords - Basic ($20/month), Premium ($40/month), and Platinum ($100/month).
3. Subscription for Agents - Silver ($50/month), Gold ($100/month), and Diamond ($200/month).
